# 🎂 Cake Weight Pricing - Complete Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

---

## 📋 Overview
Successfully implemented weight-based pricing for cakes where customers can select different weights (1 Kg, 1.5 Kg, 2 Kg, 2.5 Kg, 3 Kg) with different prices for each weight option.

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes

### Tables Modified:

#### 1. **items** table
```sql
ALTER TABLE items ADD COLUMN price_per_kg VARCHAR(500);
```
- Stores JSON: `{"1":"1500","1.5":"2000","2":"2800","2.5":"3500","3":"4200"}`

#### 2. **cart_items** table
```sql
ALTER TABLE cart_items ADD COLUMN selected_weight DOUBLE;
ALTER TABLE cart_items ADD COLUMN price_at_addition DOUBLE;
```
- `selected_weight`: Stores the weight selected (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.)
- `price_at_addition`: Stores the price when item was added to cart

#### 3. **order_items** table
```sql
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN selected_weight DOUBLE;
```
- Preserves weight information in order history

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Price showing ₹0
**Cause:** `pricePerKg` not saved or empty
**Fix:** Re-save cake with weight pricing in admin panel

### Issue 2: Total multiplying by weight
**Cause:** Frontend calculating `price × 1.5`
**Fix:** ✅ Fixed - Total now equals price for cakes

### Issue 3: Order total wrong
**Cause:** Backend using `item.price` (which is 0 for cakes)
**Fix:** ✅ Fixed - Now uses `priceAtAddition`

### Issue 4: Validation failing
**Cause:** Backend required price/grams for all items
**Fix:** ✅ Fixed - Made optional, added pricePerKg validation

## 📝 Configuration Notes

### Default Values for Cakes:
- `price`: 0 (not used)
- `grams`: 1000 (default 1kg)
- `pieces`: 1
- `pricePerKg`: JSON string with weight-price mapping

### Cart Item for Cakes:
- `quantity`: Always 1 (weight determines amount)
- `selectedWeight`: The chosen weight (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.)
- `priceAtAddition`: Calculated price including eggless if selected

### Eggless Pricing:
- For cakes: Added to weight-based price before storing in `priceAtAddition`
- For others: Added to base price (₹30 surcharge)
